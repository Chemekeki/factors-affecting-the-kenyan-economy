# factors-affecting-the-kenyan-economy

Kenya is the largest economy in East and Central Africa, but there is a
significant difference from the top African economies, and therefore has no
chance of competing with them. As a result, we ask ourselves, what are other
countries doing differently? We looked into factors that have significantly
affected the Kenyan economy and the other countries, thus improving it by
working on those factors.
The GDP of a country is one of the metrics used to determine the overall
performance of an economy. In 1963, when Kenya obtained independence and
Singapore merged with Malaysia, its GDP was $926.6 million. Singapore had a
GDP of $917.2 million at the time. In 1978, when the founding president of
Kenya died, its GDP had grown to $5.3 billion but was still less than of
Singapore, now an independent country, which had grown to $8.06 billion. By
1990, Singapore had a GDP of $38.9 billion, while Kenya was at $8.57 billion. In
addition, this trend is similar to Kenya’s and Nigeria’s GDP, which had a GDP of
just $5.165 billion, and by 2020, it was at $432.294 billion. Therefore, this
verifies the claim discussed earlier that our economy needs improvements.
We look at five broad factors which impact an economy; human resources,
capital base, political and social setup of a country, natural resources, and
technological advancements. Analyzing these factors will enable us to know
where we need to improve.


I decided to select variables that will enable us to quantify the factors
mentioned in the background, making it easier to create a model for making
predictions and analyses. We chose five predictor variables to how they affect
GDP. We obtained the data from the world bank website as their information
is accurate and up to date.
All the variables were annual data collected from 1980-2019. The data for the
response is assumed to be independent, therefore, time series component is
not considered.
